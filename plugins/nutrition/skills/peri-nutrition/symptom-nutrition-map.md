## Hot Flashes & Night Sweats

### Primary Nutrition Interventions

#### 1. Phytoestrogens (Daily Intake)

**Why**: Mild estrogenic effects may reduce frequency and severity of hot flashes

**Evidence**: Can reduce hot flashes 20-50% in some women (bioindividual response)

**Best sources**:
- **Soy products**: Tofu (3 oz), tempeh (3 oz), edamame (1/2 cup) - 1-2 servings daily
- **Ground flaxseeds**: 1-2 tablespoons daily (must grind; add to yogurt, smoothies, oatmeal)
- **Sesame seeds/tahini**: 2 tablespoons
- **Legumes**: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans (1 cup)

**Timeline**: Consistent intake for 4-6 weeks needed to notice effects

**Daily goal**: Aim for 1-2 phytoestrogen servings per day

#### 2. Blood Sugar Stability (Critical)

**Why**: Blood sugar crashes trigger hot flashes

**Strategies**:
- **Never skip meals**: Eat every 3-4 hours
- **Pair carbs with protein/fat**: Slows glucose absorption
  - Good: Apple + almond butter
  - Poor: Apple alone
- **Prioritize complex carbs**: Whole grains, legumes, starchy vegetables
- **Limit refined sugars**: Sweets, sodas, sweetened beverages
- **Regular meal timing**: Consistent schedule stabilizes blood sugar

#### 3. Magnesium (310-320 mg/day)

**Why**: May reduce frequency and severity; supports nervous system

**Form**: Magnesium bisglycinate (best absorbed, gentle on stomach)

**Food sources**:
- Pumpkin seeds (1/4 cup = 190mg)
- Almonds (1/4 cup = 95mg)
- Spinach cooked (1 cup = 157mg)
- Dark chocolate 70%+ (1 oz = 65mg)
- Black beans (1 cup = 120mg)

**Supplement**: 200-400mg before bed if diet insufficient (consult provider)

### Foods/Habits to AVOID (Common Triggers)

Track personal triggers as they vary by individual:

| Trigger | Why | Strategy |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **Spicy foods** | Raises body temperature, dilates blood vessels | Avoid or reduce during high-symptom times |
| **Hot beverages** | Directly raises core temperature | Let coffee/tea cool, or drink iced |
| **Alcohol** | Dilates blood vessels, disrupts thermoregulation | Limit to 1 drink, avoid wine/spirits if trigger |
| **Caffeine** | Stimulates nervous system, especially afternoon/evening | Cut off after 2 PM, or eliminate if sensitive |
| **Large meals at night** | Increases metabolism, body heat at bedtime | Eat dinner 2-3 hours before bed, lighter portion |
| **High-sugar foods** | Blood sugar spike then crash triggers flush | Limit sweets, processed carbs |

### Blood Sugar-Balancing Meal Examples

**Breakfast**:
- Greek yogurt (1.5 cups) + berries + almonds + ground flax
- 3 eggs + avocado + whole grain toast + tomato slices
- Tofu scramble + vegetables + olive oil + small sweet potato

**Lunch**:
- Grilled chicken (4 oz) + quinoa (1/2 cup) + mixed vegetables + tahini dressing
- Lentil soup (hearty) + side salad with olive oil + whole grain roll
- Salmon (4 oz) + brown rice (1/2 cup) + broccoli

**Dinner**:
- Tempeh (3 oz) + edamame (1/2 cup) + stir-fried vegetables + sesame seeds
- Chicken + sweet potato + green beans
- Tofu + bok choy + bell peppers + small portion rice

**Snacks** (every 3-4 hours if needed):
- Apple + almond butter
- Hummus + vegetable sticks
- String cheese + fruit
- Greek yogurt + walnuts

### Sample Day for Hot Flash Reduction

**Focus**: Phytoestrogens at every opportunity, blood sugar stability, magnesium, avoid triggers

- **Breakfast (8 AM)**: Greek yogurt bowl + blueberries + **2 tbsp ground flax** (phyto) + **almonds** (magnesium)
- **Snack (10:30 AM)**: Apple + almond butter
- **Lunch (12:30 PM)**: **Tempeh** (phyto) bowl + **edamame** (phyto) + mixed greens + quinoa + tahini
- **Snack (3:30 PM)**: **Hummus** (chickpeas = phyto) + bell peppers + carrots
- **Dinner (6:00 PM)**: Salmon + brown rice + **broccoli** + **spinach** salad
- **Evening**: Herbal tea (cooled), **magnesium** supplement if needed

**Phytoestrogen count**: 4+ servings (flax, tempeh, edamame, hummus)

---

## Sleep Disruption

### Primary Nutrition Interventions

#### 1. Magnesium Bisglycinate (Before Bed)

**Why**: Promotes relaxation, supports GABA production (calming neurotransmitter), reduces muscle tension

**Dosage**: 200-400 mg taken 1-2 hours before bed

**Food sources** (consume at dinner):
- Pumpkin seeds (1/4 cup = 190mg)
- Almonds (1/4 cup = 95mg)
- Spinach cooked (1 cup = 157mg)
- Black beans (1 cup = 120mg)
- Dark chocolate 70%+ (1 oz = 65mg)

**Supplement form**: Magnesium bisglycinate (not oxide) - better absorbed, gentler on stomach

#### 2. Tryptophan-Rich Foods (At Dinner)

**Why**: Tryptophan converts to serotonin, then to melatonin (sleep hormone)

**Best sources**:
- **Turkey**: 3 oz = high tryptophan
- **Chicken**: 3 oz = good source
- **Eggs**: 2 eggs = moderate
- **Tofu**: 5 oz = moderate
- **Pumpkin seeds**: 1/4 cup
- **Oats**: 1 cup cooked

**Tip**: Pair with complex carbs (helps tryptophan cross blood-brain barrier)

#### 3. Complex Carbohydrates (Moderate Amount at Dinner)

**Why**: Help tryptophan reach the brain; stabilize blood sugar overnight

**Best choices**:
- Sweet potato (small-medium)
- Quinoa (1/2 cup)
- Oats (if eating before bed)
- Brown rice (1/2 cup)
- Whole grain bread (1 slice)

**Avoid**: Large portions (can cause discomfort, reflux)

#### 4. B Vitamins (Throughout Day)

**B6**: Supports serotonin and melatonin production
- Sources: Chickpeas, chicken, bananas, potatoes

**B12**: Regulates sleep-wake cycles
- Sources: Animal products (meat, fish, eggs, dairy)

**Folate**: Works with B12
- Sources: Leafy greens, lentils, asparagus

### Meal Timing for Sleep

| Timing | Recommendation | Why |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| **Dinner** | 2-3 hours before bed | Allows digestion; prevents reflux |
| **Dinner size** | Moderate, not large | Large meals disrupt sleep |
| **Light snack** (if needed) | 1 hour before bed | Small, protein + carb combo |
| **Fluids** | Reduce 1-2 hours before bed | Minimizes nighttime waking to urinate |

### Foods/Habits to AVOID

| Avoid | Why | Cutoff Time |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Caffeine** | Half-life 5-6 hours; disrupts sleep architecture | After 2 PM (or none if very sensitive) |
| **Alcohol** | Disrupts REM sleep, increases night sweats, causes waking | Avoid or limit to 1 drink at dinner |
| **High-sugar snacks before bed** | Blood sugar crash causes middle-of-night waking | 2-3 hours before bed |
| **Large meals close to bedtime** | Digestive discomfort, reflux, increased metabolism | Eat dinner 2-3 hours before bed |
| **Spicy foods at dinner** | Can trigger hot flashes at night | Avoid if prone to night sweats |
| **Heavy fats late** | Slows digestion, causes discomfort | Keep dinner fats moderate |

### Sleep-Supporting Evening Meal Examples

**Dinner (6:00-6:30 PM if bedtime is 9:30-10 PM)**:

- **Turkey + sweet potato + green beans**
  - Tryptophan, complex carb, magnesium
- **Chicken + brown rice + broccoli + spinach side**
  - Tryptophan, B6, complex carb, magnesium
- **Tofu + quinoa + bok choy + sesame seeds**
  - Tryptophan, complex carb, calcium, magnesium

- Sources: Chickpeas (1 cup = 1.1mg), chicken (3 oz = 0.5mg), potatoes, bananas

**B12** (2.4 mcg/day): Mood regulation, nerve health
- Sources: Animal products (salmon, beef, eggs, dairy), fortified foods, supplement if vegan

**Folate** (400 mcg/day): Mood, methylation, works with B12
- Sources: Leafy greens, lentils (1 cup = 358mcg), asparagus, avocado

#### 3. Blood Sugar Stability (Critical for Mood)

**Why**: Blood sugar swings cause irritability, anxiety, mood crashes

**Strategies** (same as hot flashes):
- Never skip breakfast (sets mood tone for day)
- Eat protein every 3-4 hours
- Pair carbs with protein/fat
- Limit refined sugars and processed carbs
- Regular meal timing

#### 4. Magnesium (310-320 mg/day)

**Why**: Supports stress response, GABA production (calming), reduces anxiety

**Sources**: Pumpkin seeds, almonds, spinach, dark chocolate, black beans

#### 5. Protein Distribution (20-25g per Meal)

**Why**: Amino acids are neurotransmitter precursors; protein stabilizes blood sugar and mood

**Emphasis**: High-protein breakfast is critical for mood stability throughout day

**Target**: 20-25g protein at each meal

### Foods to Emphasize

| Food Category | Why | Examples |
|---------------|-----|----------|
| **Fermented foods** | Gut-brain axis; probiotics support mood | Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso |

## Energy Crashes & Fatigue

### Primary Nutrition Interventions

#### 1. Iron Optimization (Critical)

**Why**: Iron deficiency is a primary cause of exhaustion; common with heavy periods

**Target**: 18 mg/day (pre-menopause) or 8 mg/day (post-menopause)

**Best sources**:
- **Heme iron** (better absorbed): Red meat (3 oz = 2-3mg), poultry (3 oz = 1-1.5mg), fish, liver (3 oz = 5mg)
- **Non-heme iron**: Lentils (1 cup = 6.6mg), spinach (1 cup cooked = 6.4mg), fortified cereals, chickpeas (1 cup = 4.7mg)

**CRITICAL**: Pair non-heme iron with vitamin C for absorption
- Add lemon juice, tomatoes, bell peppers, broccoli, strawberries to iron-rich meals

**Avoid with iron meals**: Coffee, tea (wait 1-2 hours)

**Test**: Request ferritin test (iron stores) if chronically fatigued
- Optimal: 30-50+ ng/mL (not just "normal")

#### 2. B Vitamins (Energy Production)

**B12** (2.4 mcg/day): Essential for energy; absorption declines with age
- Sources: Animal products (salmon, beef, eggs, dairy), fortified foods
- Supplement if vegan or low stomach acid

**B6** (1.3-1.5 mg/day): Energy metabolism, neurotransmitters
- Sources: Chickpeas, chicken, potatoes, bananas

**Folate** (400 mcg/day): Cell energy production
- Sources: Leafy greens, lentils, asparagus

#### 3. Protein Distribution (20-25g per Meal)

**Why**: Sustained energy, prevents blood sugar crashes, supports muscle (which burns energy)

**Target**: 20-25g protein per meal

**Timing**: **Don't skip breakfast** - sets energy tone for day

**Best for energy**: Combine protein + complex carb + healthy fat

#### 4. Magnesium (310-320 mg/day)

**Why**: ATP (energy molecule) production requires magnesium; involved in 300+ reactions

**Sources**: Pumpkin seeds, almonds, spinach, black beans, dark chocolate

#### 5. Complex Carbohydrates (Steady Glucose)

**Why**: Brain and body's primary fuel; complex carbs provide steady energy (not spikes/crashes)

**Choose**: Whole grains, sweet potatoes, legumes, oats, quinoa

**Avoid**: Refined carbs, sugary snacks (cause energy rollercoaster)

#### 6. Hydration

**Why**: Even mild dehydration (1-2% body weight) causes fatigue, poor concentration

**Target**: ~8 cups (64 oz) water/day; adjust for activity, climate

**Tip**: If chronically tired, increase water intake and observe

### Blood Sugar Stability for Energy

| Strategy | Why | Implementation |
|----------|-----|----------------|
| **Eat regularly** | Prevents crashes | Every 3-4 hours |
| **Never skip breakfast** | Sets energy for day | High-protein breakfast essential |
| **Pair carbs with protein/fat** | Slows glucose absorption, sustains energy | Apple + almond butter, not apple alone |
| **Limit refined sugars** | Prevents spike-crash cycle | Avoid sweets, sodas, processed carbs |
| **Complex carbs** | Steady glucose release | Whole grains, sweet potato, oats, legumes |

### Foods/Habits to AVOID

| Avoid | Why | Energy Impact |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| **Skipping meals** | Blood sugar crashes | Severe fatigue, brain fog, irritability |
| **High-sugar breakfast** | Spike then crash | Mid-morning energy crash, cravings |
| **Excessive caffeine** | Masks fatigue, then crashes | Afternoon crash, poor sleep (worsens fatigue) |
| **Energy drinks** | Sugar spike + caffeine crash | Short boost, then worse fatigue |
| **Heavy lunches** | Blood diverted to digestion | Afternoon slump, sluggishness |
| **Dehydration** | Reduces energy, cognition | Fatigue, headaches, poor focus |

### Energy-Optimizing Day of Eating

**Focus**: Iron + vitamin C, B vitamins, protein at every meal, magnesium, complex carbs, hydration

- **Breakfast (HIGH PROTEIN)**: Greek yogurt bowl (1.5 cups) + berries (vit C) + ground flax + almonds + chia
  - Protein (28g), B12, calcium, magnesium, sustained energy
- **Mid-morning (hydrate + snack)**: 16 oz water + apple + almond butter
- **Lunch**: Chicken (4 oz) + quinoa + roasted vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers) + olive oil

**Best sources**: Fatty fish 2-3× per week (salmon, sardines, mackerel)

**Evidence**: Supports cognitive function, memory, reduces inflammation

#### 2. Iron

**Why**: Oxygen delivery to brain; deficiency causes brain fog, poor concentration

**Check**: Especially if fatigue + brain fog + heavy periods present

**Sources**: See iron section above; pair non-heme with vitamin C

**Test**: Ferritin levels if cognitive issues persist

#### 3. Choline (425 mg/day)

**Why**: Neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) production; supports memory and cognition

**Best sources**:
- **Eggs** (yolks): 1 egg = ~125mg choline (highest common source)
- Liver: 3 oz = 350mg
- Salmon: 3 oz = 75mg
- Chicken: 3 oz = 75mg
- Broccoli: 1 cup = 60mg

**Tip**: Eat eggs regularly (2 eggs = half daily choline needs)

#### 4. B Vitamins

**B12**: Cognitive function, nerve health (absorption declines with age)
- Sources: Animal products, fortified foods

**B6**: Neurotransmitter synthesis
- Sources: Chickpeas, chicken, potatoes, bananas

## Weight Gain & Metabolic Slowdown

### Primary Nutrition Interventions

#### 1. Protein Priority (1.0-1.2 g/kg Body Weight)

**Why**: Preserves muscle mass (maintains metabolism), highest satiety, thermic effect

**Distribution**: 20-25g per meal (critical - not one big protein meal)

**Breakfast emphasis**: High-protein breakfast boosts metabolism, reduces cravings all day

**Examples** (20-25g protein per meal):
- 3 eggs + 1 oz cheese
- 6 oz Greek yogurt
- 3-4 oz chicken, fish, lean beef
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 1 cup cooked lentils + 2 tbsp hemp seeds

#### 2. Calorie Adjustment (Gradual)

**Reality**: BMR decreases 250-300 kcal/day during transition

**Strategy**: Reduce intake by 100-300 kcal/day (gradual, sustainable)

**How to reduce**:
- Reduce portions gradually (use smaller plates, measure initially)
- Eliminate liquid calories (soda, juice, alcohol, sweetened coffee)
- Reduce between-meal snacking (or make snacks protein-based)
- Choose nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods (vegetables, lean proteins)

**What NOT to do**: Severe restriction (<1200 kcal) = metabolic adaptation, muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies

#### 3. Fiber for Satiety (25-30 g/day)

**Why**: Fills stomach, slows digestion, regulates blood sugar, supports hormone excretion

**Best sources**:
- **Vegetables**: Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, leafy greens (5+ servings daily)
- **Fruits**: Berries, pears, apples with skin (2-3 servings daily)
- **Legumes**: Lentils, beans, chickpeas (1 cup = 15g fiber)
- **Whole grains**: Oats, quinoa, brown rice
- **Nuts and seeds**: Chia, flax, almonds

#### 4. Meal Timing

| Timing Strategy | Why | Implementation |
|-----------------|-----|----------------|
| **Don't skip breakfast** | Correlates with weight management | High-protein breakfast essential |
| **Avoid grazing** | Defined meals keep insulin regulated | 3 meals + 1-2 snacks (if needed) |
| **Earlier dinner** | Metabolism slower in evening | 2-3 hours before bed |
| **Consistent schedule** | Regulates hunger hormones | Same meal times daily |

### Foods to Emphasize

| Food Category | Why | Examples |
|---------------|-----|----------|
| **Lean proteins** | High satiety, maintains muscle | Chicken, fish, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, tofu |
| **Non-starchy vegetables** | High volume, low calorie, fiber | Broccoli, spinach, peppers, zucchini, cauliflower |
| **Legumes** | Protein + fiber combo | Lentils, black beans, chickpeas |
| **Berries** | Lower-sugar fruits, high fiber | Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries |
| **Whole grains (moderate)** | Fiber, sustained energy | Quinoa, oats, brown rice (1/2 cup portions) |

### Foods to LIMIT/AVOID

| Avoid | Why | Strategy |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Refined carbs** | Low satiety, blood sugar spikes, high calorie | Limit white bread, pasta, pastries |
| **Sugary snacks** | High calorie, low nutrition, cravings | Limit cookies, candy, desserts |
| **Liquid calories** | No satiety, easy to overconsume | Eliminate soda, juice, alcohol, sweetened drinks |
| **Fried foods** | Very high calorie, inflammatory | Bake, grill, or sauté instead |
| **Large portions** | Easy to overeat even healthy foods | Measure portions, use smaller plates |

### Weight Management Day of Eating

**~1400-1600 kcal example for 154 lb woman**

- **Breakfast**: Greek yogurt (1 cup) + berries + ground flax + almonds
  - ~300 kcal, 25g protein, high satiety
- **Lunch**: Grilled chicken (4 oz) + large salad + quinoa (1/2 cup) + olive oil (1 tbsp)
  - ~400 kcal, 35g protein, high volume
- **Snack**: Apple + string cheese
  - ~150 kcal, 7g protein
- **Dinner**: Salmon (4 oz) + roasted broccoli (2 cups) + small sweet potato
  - ~450 kcal, 30g protein, nutrient-dense
- **Evening snack (if needed)**: Carrots + hummus (2 tbsp)
  - ~100 kcal, 3g protein

**Total**: ~1400 kcal, 100g protein, high fiber (30g+), very satiating, nutrient-dense

### Strategies Beyond Food

- **Mindful eating**: Slower pace, smaller plates, no distractions, chew thoroughly
- **Volumetric eating**: Emphasize high-volume, low-calorie foods (vegetables, broth-based soups)
- **Protein at every meal**: Reduces cravings, maintains muscle
- **Resistance training**: Essential for maintaining/building muscle (burns calories at rest)
- **Daily movement**: NEAT (non-exercise activity) - walking, household tasks, standing
- **Sleep**: 7-9 hours; poor sleep increases hunger hormones
- **Stress management**: Chronic stress = elevated cortisol = abdominal fat storage
- **Patience**: Weight loss is slower in perimenopause (0.5-1 lb/week is good progress)

## Heavy or Irregular Periods

### Primary Nutrition Interventions

#### 1. Iron Optimization (CRITICAL)

**Why**: Heavy periods cause significant iron loss → anemia, exhaustion

**Target**: 18 mg/day minimum during perimenopause (higher if very heavy bleeding)

**Test**: Ferritin, hemoglobin, iron panel - don't assume levels are okay

**Sources**:
- **Heme iron**: Red meat, liver, poultry, fish (better absorbed)
- **Non-heme iron**: Lentils, spinach, fortified cereals, tofu (pair with vitamin C)

**Absorption**: Pair ALL iron-rich foods with vitamin C (citrus, bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli)

**Avoid with meals**: Coffee, tea (wait 1-2 hours)

#### 2. Vitamin C

**Why**: Enhances iron absorption (critical); may help regulate heavy bleeding

**Target**: Include vitamin C source with every iron-rich meal

**Sources**: Bell peppers, broccoli, strawberries, citrus, tomatoes

#### 3. Vitamin K

**Why**: Blood clotting; may help reduce heavy menstrual flow

**Sources**:
- **K1**: Leafy greens (kale, spinach, collards), broccoli, Brussels sprouts
- **K2**: Fermented foods (natto, sauerkraut), hard cheeses, egg yolks

**Target**: Eat leafy greens daily

#### 4. Vitamin A

**Why**: May help regulate menstrual flow, supports reproductive health

**Sources**:
- Liver (highest)
- Sweet potatoes
- Carrots
- Spinach
- Cantaloupe

#### 5. Fiber (25-30 g/day)

**Why**: Helps eliminate excess estrogen (which can contribute to heavy periods)

**Sources**: Vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains

#### 6. Hydration

**Why**: Replenish fluids lost during heavy periods

**Target**: 8+ cups (64+ oz) water daily, more during menstruation

### Foods to Emphasize

| Food Category | Why | Examples |
|---------------|-----|----------|
| **Iron-rich + vitamin C** | Replenish iron lost | Lentil soup with tomatoes and lemon; spinach with strawberries |
| **Leafy greens** | Vitamin K, iron, folate | Kale, spinach, collards (cooked to reduce oxalates) |
| **Legumes** | Iron, fiber, protein | Lentils, chickpeas, black beans |
| **Liver** (if tolerated) | Highest iron, vitamin A, B12 | Chicken liver, beef liver (1-2×/month) |

### Foods to AVOID

| Avoid | Why | Strategy |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Alcohol** | Can worsen heavy bleeding | Limit or avoid during menstruation |
| **Excess caffeine** | May worsen cramping | Reduce during period |
| **High-sodium foods** | Water retention, bloating | Limit processed foods during period |

### Meal Focus During Heavy Periods

**Every meal should include**: Iron source + Vitamin C source

**Examples**:

**Breakfast**:
- Spinach omelet (3 eggs) + bell peppers + strawberries
- Fortified cereal + orange juice + scrambled eggs

**Lunch**:
- Lentil soup (high iron) + tomatoes (vit C) + red bell peppers + lemon juice
- Beef stir-fry + broccoli (vit C) + bell peppers

**Dinner**:
- Chicken liver (if tolerated) + sweet potato + Brussels sprouts
- Salmon + spinach salad with lemon dressing + tomato

**Throughout day**: Hydrate with water, herbal tea

**Supplement**: Consider iron supplement if deficient (consult provider - take with vitamin C, away from calcium)

## General Symptom Management Principles

### Holistic Approach

1. **Track symptoms + food**: Keep a log to identify personal triggers and helpful foods
2. **Consistency matters**: Nutritional interventions take 2-6 weeks to show effects
3. **Bioindividuality**: What works varies by person - experiment and observe
4. **Quality sleep**: Nutrition supports sleep; sleep supports hormone balance
5. **Stress management**: Chronic stress worsens all symptoms - nutrition + stress management together
6. **Movement**: Physical activity supports metabolism, bone health, mood, sleep
7. **Hydration**: Often overlooked but critical for energy, cognition, all body functions

### Symptom-Food Connections Summary

| Symptom | Top 3 Nutrition Priorities | Key Foods |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Hot flashes** | Phytoestrogens, blood sugar stability, magnesium | Soy, flax, legumes; balanced meals; pumpkin seeds |
| **Sleep issues** | Magnesium, tryptophan, meal timing | Almonds, turkey/chicken at dinner, no caffeine after 2 PM |
| **Mood changes** | Omega-3, B vitamins, blood sugar stability | Fatty fish, eggs, leafy greens; protein every meal |
| **Fatigue** | Iron + vitamin C, B vitamins, protein | Red meat or lentils+lemon, eggs, chicken; never skip breakfast |
| **Brain fog** | Omega-3 DHA, choline, iron | Salmon, eggs (yolks), spinach+vitamin C |
| **Weight gain** | Protein (1.0-1.2g/kg), fiber, calorie adjustment | Greek yogurt, chicken, vegetables, reduce portions |
| **Joint pain** | Omega-3, turmeric, antioxidants | Salmon, turmeric+black pepper, berries, green tea |
| **Heavy periods** | Iron + vitamin C, vitamin K, hydration | Lentils+tomatoes+lemon, leafy greens, water |

### When to Seek Additional Support

- **Severe symptoms**: Nutrition alone may not suffice; consider HRT or other medical interventions
- **Diagnosed deficiencies**: Work with provider to correct (may need supplementation)
- **No improvement**: After 6-8 weeks of consistent dietary changes, consult provider
- **Mental health concerns**: Therapy + nutrition combined approach (not nutrition alone)
- **Very heavy bleeding**: May need medical intervention; don't just supplement iron

### Integration with Lifestyle

**Nutrition is one piece**:
- Nutrition + sleep + stress management + movement = comprehensive symptom management
- Don't expect nutrition alone to fix everything
- Work with healthcare providers for personalized approach

**Sustainable changes**:
- Small, gradual changes compound over time
- Focus on adding beneficial foods, not just restricting
- Make it enjoyable - find recipes and foods you love
- Meal planning and prep make consistency easier
