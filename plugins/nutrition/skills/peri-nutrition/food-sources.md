|------|---------|------------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Tempeh | 3 oz (85g) | 50-60 | 16 | 90 | Fermented; easier digestion; probiotic |
| Tofu (firm, calcium-set) | 3 oz (85g) | 20-35 | 8-10 | 250-400 | Versatile; excellent calcium source |
| Edamame (cooked) | 1/2 cup | 16-20 | 9 | 50 | Whole soybean; high fiber |
| Soy milk (fortified) | 1 cup | 6-20 | 7-8 | 300 | Check for fortification (calcium, D) |
| Miso paste | 1 tablespoon | 6-8 | 2 | 15 | Fermented; probiotic; high sodium |

**Usage tips**:
- Choose organic soy when possible (avoid GMO)
- Fermented options (tempeh, miso) may be easier to digest
- Aim for 1-2 servings daily for hot flash reduction
- Takes 4-6 weeks of consistent intake to notice effects

### Flaxseeds (Lignans)

**Oxalate Note**: Spinach, beet greens, and Swiss chard are high in calcium BUT also high in oxalates which reduce absorption. Still eat them for other nutrients, but don't count them as primary calcium sources.

### Calcium Absorption Enhancers & Inhibitors

**Enhancers**:
- Vitamin D (essential for absorption)
- Acidic environment (stomach acid, fermented foods)
- Lactose (in dairy)
- Adequate protein (but not excessive)

**Inhibitors**:
- **Oxalates** (spinach, beet greens, rhubarb) - cooking reduces
- **Phytates** (legumes, whole grains) - soaking, sprouting reduces
- **High sodium** (increases calcium excretion)
- **Excessive caffeine** (modest effect)
- **Excessive protein** (>2 g/kg) - very high intake only

### Iron Absorption Inhibitors

**Separate by 1-2 hours from iron-rich meals**

|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Coffee** | Tannins reduce absorption 35-60% | Wait 1-2 hours after meals |
| **Tea** (black, green) | Tannins reduce absorption 60-70% | Wait 1-2 hours after meals |
| **Calcium supplements** | Competes with iron absorption | Take supplements at different time |
| **Phytates** (legumes, grains) | Binds iron | Soak, sprout, or ferment; pair with vitamin C |
| **Oxalates** (spinach, beets) | Binds iron | Cook to reduce; pair with vitamin C |

**Practical tips**:
- Drink coffee/tea between meals, not with meals
- Take calcium supplements before bed (away from iron-rich meals)
- Soak dried beans overnight before cooking (reduces phytates)
- Add acidic ingredients (tomato, lemon) to plant-based iron meals
